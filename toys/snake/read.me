description: A basic snake toy. The snake is represented by a series of boxes, each move as independent sprites, which can be driven around the screen using the PicoCalc arrow keys. Hitting 'q' quits. When the snake collides with the wall, or itself, it beeps and turns the head of the snake red. Using the arrow keys it can still be driven around, once it is no longer colliding with anything the red square will turn yellow again.
