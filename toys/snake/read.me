description: A basic snake toy. The snake is represented by a series of boxes, each move as independent sprites, which can be driven around the screen using the PicoCalc arrow keys. Hitting 'q' quits. The snake doesn't really do anything, it just bounces off the walls, it also overlaps itself, but it does demonstrate the basics of creating sprites and moving them around the screen.
