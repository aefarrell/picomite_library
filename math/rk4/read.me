description: A 4th order Runga-Kutta integrator for solving ODEs. This intended to be loaded into the library and used that way. The subroutine works in-place, filling an output array(n,m) with the answer for an n dimensional problem with m timesteps. The screenshot is from an example, solving the ode f(t,y) = -y.
